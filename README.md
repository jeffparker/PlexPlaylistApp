# Plex Playlist Exporter/Importer

A simple Python GUI app to export, import, and modify playlists on a Plex Media Server.

## Features

- **Export** playlists to JSON format
- **Import** playlists from JSON (with rename and conflict handling)
- **Modify** existing playlists: sort by year (and alphabetically for same-year items)
- Feedback indicators and non-blocking UI using threads

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeffparker/PlexPlaylistApp.git
   cd PlexPlaylistApp
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the GUI application:
```bash
python PlexPlaylistApp.py
```

1. Click **Connect to Plex** and wait for connection status.
2. Use the **Export** tab to select one or more playlists and export them to JSON.
3. Use the **Import** tab to load a JSON file, optionally rename playlists, and import them back to Plex.
4. Use the **Modify** tab to pick a playlist, sort its items by year (and title), and update the playlist on the server.

## Configuration

**No configuration is required for most users!**

By default, the app uses Plex's secure PIN login flow. When you run the app, a browser window opens for you to log in with your Plex account, and the app automatically connects to your server. This is the recommended and easiest method for most usersâ€”just run the app and follow the prompts.

**Advanced/Automated Use:**
- If you want to bypass the PIN login (for automation, scripts, or running on a headless server), you can supply your Plex server URL and authentication token either:
  - As environment variables (`PLEX_URL` and `PLEX_TOKEN`), or
  - By editing `plex_utils.py` to hardcode your credentials.

Most users should not need to do this. These options are only for special circumstances, such as automated workflows or servers without a browser. If you are unsure, just use the default PIN login.
